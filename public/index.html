    <h1 id="title">Lahaina Twin Project</h1>
    <p id="text">The Lahaina Twin Project is an online platform that encourages public participation in the process of
        reconstructing Lahaina, Maui. It does this by offering forums, polls, and the sharing of design concepts
        together with data and visual models for analysis of the economy, ecology, etc. Its goal is to make it possible
        for a collaborative planning response to Lahaina's wildfire devastation. Our goal is for this effort to unite
        individuals in support of rebuilding Lahaina according to Maui's wishes.
